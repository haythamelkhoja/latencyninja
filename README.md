# Latency Ninja

<img src="latencyninjalogosmall.png" alt="Latency Ninja" align="right" />  Latency Ninja is a user-friendly wrapper for `tc/netem`. It is designed to emulate network perturbations for interfaces and networks. It is tailored for simulating network perturbations during chaos engineering exercises, and multi-region, distributed and hybrid cloud deployment simulations. It allows you to introduce latency, jitter, corruption, duplication, reordering, and packet loss to both ingress and egress traffic simultaneously, circumventing the limitations of `tc/netem` that typically would apply rules on egress only.

## Key Features

* üïí Latency: Control network delay, enabling you to mimic real-world scenarios with adjustable latency settings.
* üîÑ Jitter: Introduce variability to latency, replicating the unpredictable nature of network traffic.
* üí• Corruption: Corrupt a defined percentage of packets to assess network and application resilience.
* ‚ú® Duplication: Duplicate packets to evaluate network performance under data replication scenarios.
* üîÄ Reordering: Test how your applications handle out-of-sequence packets with customizable reordering.
* üëª Packet Loss: Simulate packet loss, a crucial factor in assessing application robustness.
* üß≠ Direction: Apply conditions to both incoming and outgoing traffic for comprehensive real-world testing. 
  * üì• Ingress and üì§ Egress: Apply conditions to both incoming and outgoing traffic simultenaously. 
  * üì• Ingress Traffic Only: Apply conditions to incoming traffic.
  * üì§ Egress Traffic Only: Apply conditions to outgoing traffic.
* üéØ Target Multiple Destination IP/Networks: Specify the destination IP addresses or networks.
* üåç Filter by Source IP/Network: Specify the source IP address or network.
* <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">{ }</span> JSON Support: Allows performing network conditions programmatically.

To use a JSON file using the --json option, run:

      ./latencyninja \
                  --json file.json


Make sure the JSON file is formated using the following template:

      {
            "interface": "ens192",
            "src_ip": "192.168.100.121",
            "dst_ip": "192.168.100.123:80~443,192.168.100.0/24",
            "direction": "egress",
            "latency": "30",
            "jitter": "5",
            "packet_loss": "0.5",
            "duplicate": "1",
            "corrupt": "0.1",
            "reorder": "2"
      }

To display current network perturbations rules, run:

      ./latencyninja --query

To roll back previously applied network perturbations, run:

      ./latencyninja \
                  --interface eth0 \
                  --rollback

## Updating

To update Latency Ninja to the lastest version, run:

    ./latencyninja --update

## Warning
- Any changes made by Latency Ninja will not persist after a reboot or a network restart (yet)

## Troubleshooting
 - Permission Denied: Make sure you're running the script with superuser privileges.
 - Interface Error: Ensure that the provided network interface exists and is up.
 - Missing Parameters: Always ensure that mandatory parameters like -i and -d are provided, except for when rolling back (using -r), which requires -i only.

## Roadmap
- Persist network perturbations policies after network interface restart and reboots.
- Schedule rollbacks.
