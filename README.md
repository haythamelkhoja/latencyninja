# Latency Ninja

Latency Ninja is a wrapper tool built around `tc/netem`, designed to empower you with the ability to simulate network perturbations on a specified network interface and destination IP address. It allows you to introduce latency, jitter, corruption, duplication, reordering, and packet loss to both ingress and egress traffic simultaneously, circumventing the limitations of `tc/netem` that typically would apply rules on egress only.

## Key Features

- ðŸ•’ Latency: Control network delay, enabling you to mimic real-world scenarios with adjustable latency settings.
- ðŸ”„ Jitter: Introduce variability to latency, replicating the unpredictable nature of network traffic.
- ðŸ’¥ Corruption: Corrupt a defined percentage of packets to assess network and application resilience.
- âœ¨ Duplication: Duplicate packets to evaluate network performance under data replication scenarios.
- ðŸ”€ Reordering: Test how your applications handle out-of-sequence packets with customizable reordering.
- ðŸ“¦ Packet Loss: Simulate packet loss, a crucial factor in assessing application robustness.
- ðŸ“¥ Ingress and ðŸ“¤ Egress Traffic: Apply conditions to both incoming and outgoing traffic for comprehensive testing.

## Compatibility

Latency Ninja is compatible with Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora/Debian/Ubuntu Linux-based systems and requires superuser privileges to run.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have `tc` and `netem` installed on your system.
2. Root or superuser privileges are required to run the script.

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/haythamelkhoja/latencyninja
    cd latencyninja
    chmod +x latency_ninja.sh    
    ./latency_ninja.sh [ARGS]

 ## Usage

    ./latency_ninja.sh [ARGS]
        
    Arguments:
    -h                    Display this help message.
    -r                    Rollback any networking conditions changes and redirections.
    -i <interface>        Network interface (e.g., eth0).
    -d <destination_ip>   Destination IP address.
    -l <latency>          Desired latency in milliseconds (e.g., 30).
    -j <jitter>           Desired jitter in milliseconds (e.g., 3).
    -x <packet_loss>      Desired packet loss percentage (e.g., 2 for 2%).
    -y <duplicate>        Desired duplicate packet percentage (e.g., 2 for 2%).
    -z <corrupt>          Desired corrupted packet percentage (e.g., 1 for 1%).
    -k <reorder>          Desired packet reordering percentage (e.g., 1 for 1%).
    -p <num_pings>        Number of pings for the test (default: 5).

## Example
To simulate 100ms latency, 10ms jitter, and 5% packet loss on the eth0 interface for traffic going to 192.168.1.10, run:

    ./latency_ninja.sh -i eth0 -d 192.168.1.10 -l 100 -j 10 -x 5

To roll back previously applied network perturbations, run:

    ./latency_ninja.sh -i eth0 -r

## Warning
- Any changes made by Latency Ninja will not persist after a reboot or a network restart (yet)

## Troubleshooting
 - Permission Denied: Make sure you're running the script with superuser privileges.
 - Interface Error: Ensure that the provided network interface exists and is up.
 - Missing Parameters: Always ensure that mandatory parameters like -i and -d are provided, except for when rolling back (using -r), which requires -i only.

## Roadmap
- Persist network perturbations policies after network interface restart and reboots.
- Apply rules to egress and ingress seperatly based on user choice.
- Schedule rollback.
- Auto download dependencies.
- Add traffic shaping capabilities.
- Support and test a wider range of scenarios such as:
-- Ability to apply rule on entire network range /24 or /16 etc.. 
-- Ability to apply rule on interface (not only on destination)
-- Ability to apply rule only on source only
-- Ability to apply rule on destination/source ports
